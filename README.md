Introduction

In this project we will analyze the portugese bank marketing data using the CRISP Data Modelling 
framework available in AIML and identify the features in the data set that denotes the subscriptions to the product. 
As a result of this analysis, we will be able to identify the features that indicates the potential customers , so the marketing 
team could focus on the group. Different classifying models will be trained to perform this prediction, their accuracy and timing 
it takes to train the data is recorded to find the best fit for this problem.

#Overview


Python program we developed will go through the below CRISP DM framework phases and Business understanding :
From the business perspective understand the key drivers of car prices. 
Data understanding : Explore the data set and look for any quality issues. 
Data preparation : Removal of NAN value rows and ensuring the features that needs to be type casted to integers as a prerequisite for modelling. 
Modelling : Create several regression models and train it with price as target. 
Evaluation : Evaluate the model and validate the results 
Deployment : Once evaluation is satisfactory deploy the model.

**Deliverables**

We used following data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) , 
create a model to predict the subscriptions to the product. List the features that has significant impact towards the subscriptions.
A report will be created with the findings from the models we created along with the recommendations to the banks.

**Conclusion**

Most effecient model will be determined , it could be used by the banks to group the potential customers with higher rate of successful subscription.
